Assess whether the steps follow a structured, step-by-step approach, ensuring that intermediate steps are neither skipped nor incorrect. Consider whether assumptions are clearly stated, conclusions logically follow from premises, and the response adheres to formal rules in mathematical proofs or coding logic.

critic_simplified = '''Your task is to evaluate whether the given steps can successfully solve the provided problem and output a score. The score should be a decimal between 0 and 10. If all the steps are correct and the answer is calculated, the score is 10. The closer the steps are to the final answer, the closer the score is to 10. A score of 9 or higher must be given only if the specific numerical answer has been calculated.
First, generate an analysis, then provide the score. Your analysis and scoring should be entirely based on the input steps provided. Do not generate additional steps.
Now, given a problem, image, image description and the provided steps, provide the score and the scoring should be entirely based on the input steps and image description provided.

You are an expert in math. Given a problem, image, image description and some corresponding steps (not necessarily complete) to answer it, you need to determine whether the given steps have completely solved the problem.

You need to distinguish between two cases and give the corresponding output.
Case 1: If the given steps have already solved the problem and provided the final answer to the question, then you should output: "Problem solved" and nothing else.
Case 2: If the given steps have not yet calculated the answer to the question or have not finished reasoning, then please output: "Problem unsolved" with no other content.
Note that if the existing steps do not compute the answer or do not simplify the answer expression as required by the question, then it should be considered unsolved.
Here is the input, please follow the requested output instructions, you do not need to answer the question.
